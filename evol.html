<h1 class="tab">EVOLUTION OF PHOTOGRAPHY</h1></center>

<h2 class="tea">FILM</h2>
<p class="oh"><img src ="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\web\images\film.jfif" height="230" width="300"><b><i>Hurter and Driffield began pioneering work on the light sensitivity of 
photographic emulsions in 1876.Their work enabled the first quantitative measure of film speed to be devised.<br>
<br>
The first flexible photographic roll film was marketed by George Eastman, founder of Kodak in 1885, but this original "film" was actually a coating on a paper base. 
As part of the processing, the image-bearing layer was stripped from the paper and transferred to a hardened gelatin support. The first transparent plastic roll film 
followed in 1889. It was made from highly flammable nitrocellulose known as nitrate film.Films remained the dominant form of photography until the early 21st century 
when advances in digital photography drew consumers to digital formats.Although modern photography is dominated by digital users, film continues to be used by 
enthusiasts and professional photographers. The distinctive "look" of film based photographs compared to digital images is likely due to a combination of factors, 
including: differences in spectral and tonal sensitivity (S-shaped density-to-exposure (H&D curve) with film vs linear response curve for digital CCD sensors) 
resolution and continuity of tone.</i></b></p>

<h2 class="tea">BLACK-AND-WHITE</h2>
<p class="hey"><img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\web\images\bw.jfif" height="230" width="300"><b><i>Originally, all photography was monochrome, or black-and-white. 
Even after color film was readily available, black-and-white photography continued to dominate for decades, due to its lower cost, chemical stability, 
and its "classic" photographic look.<br>
<br>
Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented 
as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, 
mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard RGB 
color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.</i></b></p>

<h2 class="tea">COLOR</h2>
<p class="oh"><img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\web\images\clr.jpg" height="220" width="300"><b><i>Color photography was explored beginning in the 1840s. 
Early experiments in color required extremely long exposures (hours or days for camera images) and could not "fix" the photograph to prevent the color from quickly 
fading when exposed to white light.<br>
<br>
Color photography may form images as positive transparencies, which can be used in a slide projector, or as color negatives intended for use in creating positive color enlargements 
on specially coated paper. The latter is now the most common form of film (non-digital) color photography owing to the introduction of automated photo printing equipment. 
After a transition period centered around 1995â€“2005, color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi-megapixel digital cameras. Film continues to be the 
preference of some photographers because of its distinctive "look".</i></b></p>

<h2 class="tea">DIGITAL</h2>
<p class="hi"><img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\web\images\dg.jpg" height="225" width="300"><b><i>In 1981, Sony unveiled the first consumer camera to use a charge-coupled 
device for imaging, eliminating the need for film: the Sony Mavica. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera was not fully digital.<br>
<br>
Digital imaging uses an electronic image sensor to record the image as a set of electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film. An important difference between digital and chemical 
photography is that chemical photography resists photo manipulation because it involves film and photographic paper, while digital imaging is a highly manipulative medium. This difference 
allows for a degree of image post-processing that is comparatively difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications.<br>
<br>
Digital photography dominates the 21st century. More than 99% of photographs taken around the world are through digital cameras, increasingly through smartphones.</i></b></p>

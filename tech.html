<div class="flexcont">
<h3 style="color:crimson">CAMERAS</h3>
<div><b>The camera (or 'camera obscura') is a dark room or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light is excluded except the light that forms the image. It was discovered 
and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to very large, a whole room that is kept 
dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated.</b></div>


<h3 style="color:coral">STEREOSCOPIC</h3>
<div><b>Photographs, both monochrome and color, can be captured and displayed through two side-by-side images that emulate human stereoscopic vision. Stereoscopic photography was 
the first that captured figures in motion.While known colloquially as "3-D" photography, the more accurate term is stereoscopy.</b></div>

<h3 style="color:crimson">DUAL<br>PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
<div><b>Dualphotography consists of photographing a scene from both sides of a photographic device at once (e.g. camera for back-to-back dualphotography, or two networked cameras 
for portal-plane dualphotography). The dualphoto apparatus can be used to simultaneously capture both the subject and the photographer, or both sides of a geographical 
place at once, thus adding a supplementary narrative layer to single image.</b></div>

<h3 style="color:crimson">FULL-SPECTRUM</h3>
<div><b>Ultraviolet and infrared films have been available for many decades and employed in a variety of photographic avenues since the 1960s. New technological trends in digital 
photography have opened a new direction in full spectrum photography, where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.</b>
</div>

<h3 style="color:coral">LAYERING</h3>
<div><b>Layering is a photographic composition technique that manipulates the foreground, subject or middle-ground, and background layers in a way that they all work together 
to tell a story through the image.Layers may be incorporated by altering the focal length, distorting the perspective by positioning the camera in a certain spot.People, movement, 
light and a variety of objects can be used in layering.</b></div>

<h3 style="color:crimson">LIGHT FIELD</h3>
<div><b>Digital methods of image capture and display processing have enabled the new technology of "light field photography" (also known as synthetic aperture photography). 
This process allows focusing at various depths of field to be selected after the photograph has been captured.As explained by Michael Faraday in 1846, the "light field" is 
understood as 5-dimensional, with each point in 3-D space having attributes of two more angles that define the direction of each ray passing through that point.</b></div>

<h1 class="kab"><center><i>TYPES OF PHOTOGRAPHY</i></center></h1><br>
<h2 id="my">PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
<div class="use">
<p>One of the most common photography styles, portrait photography, or portraiture, aims to capture the personality and mood of an individual or group. 
Images may be candid or posed, full body or close-ups. Either way, the subject’s face and eyes are typically in focus. Lighting and backdrop help to convey tone and emotion. 
Popular types of photography portraits include senior portraits, family portraits, engagement photos, and professional headshots. The best portrait photographers make clients 
feel completely comfortable, so that their expressions are natural and relaxed.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="my">PHOTOJOURNALISM</h2>
<div class="use">
<p>Photojournalism is a way of telling the story of a newsworthy (perhaps even historic) event or scene through photographs. Photojournalism should be as objective 
and truthful as possible and capturing candid moments as they happen is more important than getting picture-perfect shots. Generally, photojournalists attend planned events with 
the hope of capturing unplanned, unscripted moments. Their work is routinely published in magazines and newspapers.</p>
</div>

<br>

<h2 id="my">FASHION PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
<div class="use">
<p>Fashion photography showcases and glamorizes fashion clothing, shoes, and accessories to make them more desirable to consumers. It is commonly published in magazines 
and online. People may choose this niche over different types of photography because of the opportunity to be highly creative in making photographs eye-catching and appealing. 
Fashion photographers take a lot of full body shots and work in an array of locations, from fashion shows to studios with full lighting setups to city streets and open fields. 
They utilize many of the same skills as portrait photographers and must practice good teamwork and communication when working with shoot stylists, creative directors, and models.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="my">SPORTS PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
<div class="use">
<p>By catching athletes, coaches, and even fans at the perfect moment, sports photographs can depict the passion, drama, and emotion that fuels sporting events. 
Sports photographers must aim and shoot quickly to keep up with the action around them, and it’s best practice to use a higher ISO to shoot at a faster shutter speed. 
Sports photographers also usually use long, heavy lenses for zooming in on the action. Interesting angles can help make your work stand out in this competitive genre.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="my">STILL LIFE PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
<div class="use">
<p>Like it sounds, still life photography features inanimate objects—natural or manmade. Still life photography can be artistic or commercial. It is commonly used in stock 
photography as well as product advertising. (Think of the product images shown in catalogs, magazines, and billboards.) For still life photographers, object selection, arrangement, 
and lighting are key to getting a great shot.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="my">EDITORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
<div class="use">
<p>Editorial photography is taken to illustrate a story or article, typically for a magazine or newspaper. The subject of editorial photography can vary widely and is entirely 
dependent on the topic of the text it accompanies. Generally, for editorial photography, you’ll want to get shots that work for a variety of layouts, including horizontal and 
vertical compositions. When working in editorial photography, you are likely to work closely with writers and art directors, and demonstrating good communication skills and 
professionalism will help you succeed.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="my">ARCHITECTURAL PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
<div class="use">
<p>Both the interior and exterior design of buildings and structures are the subject of architectural photography. From warehouses to city bridges to old country barns, 
this genre encompasses diverse structures. Often, the photograph showcases the structure’s most aesthetically pleasing parts, such as a particular beam or archway. 
Interesting materials and colors may also be emphasized. Lighting can be challenging in architectural photography and, for exteriors, photographers must know how to work with 
natural light. Gear such as a tilt-shift lens, a tripod, and a panorama head is often useful. Architectural photographs can be of value to designers, architects, leasing companies, 
and building investors.</p>

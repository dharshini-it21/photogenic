           <p>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor,
              or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
           <p>The first permanent photo etching was an image produced in 1822 by the French inventor Nicéphore Niépce, but it was destroyed in a later attempt to 
              make prints from it.Niépce was successful again in 1825.</p>

           <p>The science of photography is the use of chemistry and physics in all aspects of photography. This applies to the camera, its lenses, physical 
              operation of the camera, electronic camera internals, and the process of developing film in order to take and develop pictures properly.</p>

           <h2>PHOTOS AS A RETURN TICKET</h2>
           <p>Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries, relating to seeing an image and capturing the image.</p>
           <p>The aesthetics of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed regularly, especially in artistic circles. 
              Many artists argued that photography was the mechanical reproduction of an image.</p>

           <h2>PROCESS</h2>
           <p>Photography – the process of making pictures by the action of recording light patterns, reflected or emitted from objects,
            on a photosensitive medium or an image sensor through a timed exposure. The process is done through mechanical, chemical, or electronic devices known as cameras.</p>
